## arnav surve ðŸª¬

I'm a third-year student at California State Univerity, Sacramento pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Currently, Linux and DevOps engineering have been of key interest to me. I have been working through this DevOps Roadmap and studying for my AWS SysOps Administrator - Associate certification.

I am focused on developing a strong foundation in Go and Python programming, as well as gaining hands-on experience with the Ubuntu server environment on an old 2017 Macbook Pro. I have experience with both Debian (apt) and RHEL (dnf) based distributions.
